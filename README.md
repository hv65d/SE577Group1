## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.

2. Clone your forked repo.

3. Download the latest version of [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your OS. Install with the default options and remember the admin password you set.

4. Open pgAdmin 4 (this comes with Postgres) and create a new database called "TrainDemo".

5. Unzip `amtrak_sql.zip` and run `init_tables.sql` then `init_data.sql` on your new database. This populates our database with some initial tables and data. The easiest way to run queries is with Query Tool (`Tools > Query Tool`) in pgAdmin 4.

6. Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your Postgres password. Make sure not to commit changes to this file to source control.

7. Add your GitHub `client-id` and `client-secret` to your `application.properites`.

8. Run the project in IntelliJ, Eclipse, or on the command line with
    ```
    mvnw clean package
    java -jar target/TrainDemo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
